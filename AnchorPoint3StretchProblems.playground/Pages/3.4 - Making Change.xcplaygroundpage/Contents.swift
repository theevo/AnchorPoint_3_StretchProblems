 # Thursday Stretch Problem 3.4
 ## Making Change
 
 ### Instructions:
 Make a function that takes in a given amount of money (i.e. 2.15) and returns a string of the amount of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to make that amount of money. Return something like: Your change is 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, and 1 penny.
 
 ### Black Diamond 💎💎💎
 Make a function that takes in the cost of an item, and the amount of money paid (i.e. cost: $2.15, amount paid: $5.00) and then returns a string detailing the amount of change in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
 
 When this works, try to recreate Swift's built-in filter function. Just like the Swift function, it should be generic and it should take a closure that returns a Bool, from which it determines how to filter your sequence type.
